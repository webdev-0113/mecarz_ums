To test your system supports run-time loading go to:
http://www.domain.com/directory/ioncube/ioncube-rtl-tester.php

Another problem is related to wrong file upload and therefore a message saying that a certain file is corrupt. Please re-upload the file(s) making sure that you are using binary mode.
